// Content-addressable tarball cache, shared across agent instances on
// the sidecar.
//
// Tarballs are immutable bytes addressed by their SRI integrity. The
// cache lives at `rootDir/sha512/<2-char>/<rest>/tarball.tgz`. Get
// returns cached bytes or null; put verifies bytes against the
// integrity, writes them atomically, and evicts least-recently-used
// entries until the total cache size is under maxBytes. Evict removes
// one entry (used after extraction discovers a corrupted file on disk).
//
// `maxBytes` covers both the tarball bytes and the size of the
// extracted directory tree the loader copies from. The extraction
// tree dominates disk usage in practice (tarballs are gzip-compressed;
// the unpacked tree is multiples larger), so the cap reflects the cost
// of holding one cache entry but excludes the loader's per-instance
// copies.
//
// Integrity is verified on store and re-verified inside
// `extractTarball` before unpacking. `get` returns bytes without
// re-hashing — callers that route through `extractTarball` get the
// extra check for free; callers that consume the bytes directly are
// trusted to validate as appropriate.
//
// `extractTarball` is the second face of the same on-disk store: it
// unpacks the tarball into a sibling `extracted/` directory keyed by
// the same integrity, so the per-instance loader can copy from a
// stable, deduplicated extraction without re-doing the tar work on
// every apply. The unpack is gated by a per-integrity tmp-and-rename
// dance with the same crash-safety properties as `put`.
