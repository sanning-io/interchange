//
// - misled: HTTP succeeded and the model responded normally, but the
//   provider's documented contract for the input did not materialize.
//   The model did not refuse — there is no statement of inability in
//   the response — the documented behavior just did not fire. Used when
//   the wire shape is conditional on external state we do not control
//   (e.g. Anthropic's safety classifier not engaging on the documented
//   redacted-thinking canary). The fixture on disk documents what was
//   actually returned; smoke test validates file presence. A future
//   re-capture may flip the row to captured.
//
// - refused: the provider's response contains an explicit refusal of
//   the requested task. The model told us it would not do the thing —
//   sometimes via HTTP non-2xx, sometimes via a successful HTTP body
//   carrying a textual refusal. No fixture by convention; the refusal
//   detail goes in notes.
//
// - http-error: the provider returned a non-2xx HTTP status. No fixture.
//
// - unsupported: the provider does not support this capability. No
//   fixture, no attempt made.
