-- Re-point the offering foreign key off the agent onto the folded workflow
-- definition. The column keeps its agent_id name -- the offering API exposes
-- agentId -- but its values become workflow_definition ids: every agent was
-- folded to exactly one definition, linked by workflow_definition.origin_agent_id
-- (a partial unique index, so the join matches at most one definition).
--
-- The guard runs before any write. The production path applies migrations under
-- `drizzle-kit migrate`, which wraps the pending set in a transaction, and
-- PostgreSQL DDL is transactional, so an aborting guard rolls the whole set
-- back -- there is no partial commit to defend against. It aborts loudly if any
-- offering's agent has no folded definition, meaning the agent fold has not
-- run; the total fold makes that impossible in a folded database, so the guard
-- is a fail-loud assertion.
