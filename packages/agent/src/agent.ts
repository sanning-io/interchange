// In-process agent runtime.
//
// `createAgent(def, env)` is the single entry point. The `def` is the
// portable, hashable `AgentDefinition` (id, system prompt, tool
// factories, director ref, inference preferences, capabilities, tags).
// The `env` is the runtime environment supplying the active inference
// source, the context store, the working directory, the audit sink,
// the authorize callback, and the director registry. The agent
// instantiates against those: it locks the context directory, walks
// each tool factory to build its tool runner, resolves the director
// against the registry, and wires the result into the reactor
// assembly. The reactor is wrapped exactly once.
//
// Composition:
//   - `send()` enqueues into a FIFO `SendQueue` capped at
//     `env.sendQueueMax`. Per-send `AbortSignal` removes queued items or
//     rejects in-flight callers while letting the reactor cycle finish
//     in the background.
//   - `stream()` returns a bounded `StreamConsumer` iterator; consumers
//     buffer independently and noisy backpressure poisons only the
//     affected iterator.
//   - `close()` aborts the reactor, drains the send queue with
//     `AgentClosedError`, terminates every active stream iterator, waits
//     up to `env.closeTimeoutMs` for the reactor's shutdown sequence to
//     complete (audit flush, in-flight commits), and finally releases
//     the singleton-per-`workdir` lock so another agent can open the
//     same directory.
//
// `setSource` covers the whole source: id/provider/baseURL/apiKey/model
// plus the model-bound `defaults` and `capabilities`. Credentials and
// model rotate together via the shared source object the reactor reads
// lazily at the start of each inference call. The director never names
// a model -- `capabilities.infer(options?)` does not take one -- so the
// active source's model is the single source of truth and rotations
// take effect on the next inference call without any wrapper.
//
// Tool factories are bundle-shaped: each declares `(env) => ToolBundle`
// via `defineTool`. The agent invokes each factory once at construction,
// collects the bundles' definitions, and dispatches calls to the
// owning bundle's `run`. Bundle lifetimes (and any `dispose` step) are
// the caller's responsibility -- the env is the agent's dependency
// contract; the caller owns the lifetime of what it puts in env.
