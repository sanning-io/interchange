// `defineTool` / `defineDirector` `requires` metadata; the runtime
// `validateEnv` (see `env-validation.ts`)
// asserts presence of every declared key before the agent constructs a
// reactor.
//
// `audit`, `authorize`, and `directors` are required fields. There are
// no read-site defaults: a caller that omits them is making an
// affirmative choice the env contract rejects. No-op implementations for
// tests and examples ship from `@intx/agent/testing`.
